       "\"gross profit for plant nutrition north america was favorably impacted by higher sales volumes and lower per-unit product costs , which were partially offset by increased per-unit shipping and handling costs and higher depreciation expense during 2017. a $ 61.6 million decrease in salt segment gross margin partially offset the combined plant nutrition business ' increase . the decrease resulted from lower sales volumes , increased per-unit product and increased shipping and handling costs , and higher depreciation expense . gross profit & gross margin commentary : 2015 – 2016 gross profit : decreased 9 % , or $ 30.6 million ; gross margin decreased 4 percentage points to 26 % from 30 % salt gross profit declined $ 17.1 million primarily due to reduced sales prices and higher per-unit production costs . the decrease was partially offset by lower logistics costs . the plant nutrition business , on a combined basis , contributed $ 10.8 million to the decrease in gross profit primarily due to lower average sales prices realized in our plant nutrition north america segment , partially offset by the inclusion of the results from produquímica following the acquisition in october 2016. in addition , plant nutrition north america experienced higher per-unit shipping and handling costs . other expenses and income commentary : 2016 – 2017 sg & a : increased $ 42.5 million , which represented a 1.3 percentage points of sales increase to 12.3 % from 11.0 % the increase in sg & a expense was primarily due to the full year inclusion of produquímica in our operating results in 2017 and approximately $ 2 million in higher corporate depreciation related to a significant software system upgrade . in addition , we incurred charges of approximately $ 2 million related to ongoing restructuring activities primarily impacting corporate sg & a . interest expense : increased $ 18.8 million to $ 52.9 million the increase was primarily due to our higher aggregate debt level driven by the acquisition of produquímica , which was partially offset by lower interest rates due to the refinancing of our term loans and revolving credit facility in april 2016. net ( earnings ) loss in equity investee : increased from a loss of $ 1.4 million to earnings of $ 0.8 million the $ 0.8 million of earnings in 2017 represents our share of fermavi eletroquímica ltda . 's ( “ fermavi ” ) net earnings . as a result of the full acquisition of produquímica , we hold a 50 % interest in fermavi , which was previously held by produquímica . the $ 1.4 million loss in 2016 was primarily comprised of our share of produquímica 's net loss based on our initial 35 % equity interest in produquímica prior to the full acquisition . gain from remeasurement of equity method investment we recognized a gain of $ 59.3 million in 2016 related to our previously held equity investment in produquímica , which was remeasured to fair value upon our full acquisition of the business in october 2016. other expense ( income ) , net : increased $ 3.3 million to $ 4.4 million the increase was primarily due to foreign exchange losses of $ 7.1 million in 2017 , compared to losses of $ 0.1 million in 2016. the increase was partially offset by the inclusion of $ 3.0 million of refinancing fees in 2016 and increased interest income in 2017. income tax expense : increased $ 25.4 million to $ 60.0 million income tax expense and our income tax rate increased in 2017 due to the impact of u.s. tax reform , which resulted in an increase in tax expense of $ 46.8 million , and due to a tax settlement agreement . these increases were partially offset by the release of valuation allowances related to our brazil business . our effective tax rate was 58 % in 2017 and 18 % in 2016. our effective tax rates were impacted by u.s. tax reform and a tax settlement agreement in 2017 and the non-taxable gain recognized from the remeasurement of our previously held equity investment in produquímica in 2016. replace_table_token_38_th compass minerals international , inc. our income tax provision in both periods differs from the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to u.s.

reporting purposes . other expenses and income commentary : 2015 – 2016 sg & a : increased $ 16.2 million , which represented a 1.1 percentage points of sales increase to 9.9 % from 11.0 % the increase in expense was due to the inclusion of produquímica 's results and higher expenses in our plant nutrition north america segment due to the $ 3.1 million partial impairment of our wolf trax trade name and corporate restructuring costs . this increase was partially offset by a decrease of $ 2.0 million in corporate professional services and a decrease of $ 1.8 million in marketing expenses in our plant nutrition north america and salt segments . interest expense : increased $ 12.6 million to $ 34.1 million the increase was primarily due to our higher aggregate debt level driven by the acquisition of produquímica , which was partially offset by lower interest rates due to the refinancing of our term loans and revolving credit facility in april 2016. net ( earnings ) loss in
